Welcome to my website! I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Emory University. I’m originally from Ecuador, where I earned a B.A. in Economics from [ESPOL](https://www.espol.edu.ec/es). I also hold an M.Sc. in Economics from [EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/) University in Colombia. During my time at EAFIT, I worked as a research and teaching assistant in the Department of Macroeconomics and Financial Systems.

I’m passionate about economic research, with a strong interest in financial economics and econometrics. I’m also an enthusiastic learner of mathematics and constantly seek to deepen my understanding in this area.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
